Weyers Publication: Materials Journal Volume: 95 Issue: 6 Pages: 675-680 Keywords: chloride-induced corrosion; concrete; corrosion cracking model; time-to-cracking Date: November 1, 1998 Abstract: The time to cracking, from corrosion initiation to cracking of the reinforcing steel cover concrete, is one of the critical time periods for modeling the time to repair, rehabilitate and replace reinforced concrete structures in corrosive environments. The time-to-corrosion cracking was experimentally determined from simulated bridge deck slabs. The experimental design considered corrosion rate, concrete cover depth, reinforcing steel bar spacing and size. Three, of the 14 slab series, cracked during the 5 year study. Metal loss was determined for the cracked specimens which had cover depths of 1, 2, and 3 in. (25, 51, and 76 mm). A time-to-corrosion cracking model was developed considering the critical amount of corrosion products which consists of the amount of corrosion products needed to fill the interconnected void space around the reinforcing bar plus the amount of corrosion products needed to generate sufficient tensile stresses to crack the cover concrete. The experimentally observed time to cracking is in good agreement with the model predicted time to cracking.},

abstract = {Corrosion damage is one of the main problems affecting the durability of concrete structures. Several corroded reinforced concrete (RC) railway bridges are located in regions of high seismic risk. Corroded bridge piers are often subjected to dynamic axial loads, such as the vertical pounding that occurs during earthquakes or due to railway trains. Repeated axial loading was used to simulate this vertical pounding effect. Therefore, the seismic performance of corroded RC structures under repeated axial and horizontal cyclic loading is an urgent issue. To investigate the influences of steel corrosion and repeated axial loading on the seismic performance of a column pier, eight RC column speci-mens were experimentally investigated. The results indicated that corrosion significantly influences the yield strength and load bearing capacity of a column. The load bearing capacities of the corroded specimens decreased by 18.27{\%} compared with noncorroded specimens when the longitudinal loss of steel mass was 7.16{\%}. Repeated axial loading did not significantly influence the mechanical properties of the cor-roded RC piers. Cyclic tests were performed to validate a finite-element model that was used to assess the effects of corrosion level on the seis-mic performance of columns. The level of steel corrosion ranged from 0 to 28{\%}. According to the finite-element analysis, the yield strength (35{\%}) and ultimate displacement (34{\%}) decreased with increasing corrosion.},

abstract = {In this paper, probabilistic drift and shear force capacity models are developed for corroding reinforced concrete (RC) columns. The developments represent a merger between a probabilistic model for chloride-induced corrosion, a time-dependent corrosion rate, and previously developed probabilistic models for drift and shear force capacity of pristine (undamaged) RC columns. Fragility estimates are obtained for an example corroding column by applying the developed models at given shear and drift demands. Model uncertainties in both the capacity and corrosion models are considered in the fragility estimation, in addition to uncertainties in environmental conditions, material properties, and structural geometry. Sensitivity analyses of the corroding RC column are carried out to identify the parameters to which the reliability of the example column is most sensitive. The developed models consider different combinations of chloride exposure condition, environmental oxygen availability, water-to-cement ratios, and curing conditions. They are applicable to both existing and new RC columns and may be employed for the prediction of service-life and life-cycle cost analysis of RC structures.},

New reinforced concrete corrosion initiation, corrosion rate and time-variant load models are proposed. Three durability design specifications are considered in a lifetime reliability analysis of a RC slab bridge. Time-variant increases in loads are considered also. It was found that the application of de-icing salts causes significant long-term deterioration and reduction in structural safety for poor durability design specifications. A reduced cover or increased water-cement ratio increases failure probabilities. When compared to the case of “no deterioration”, it was observed also that the probability of failure only marginally increased for good durability design specifications.

Although the cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel has been extensively studied, very little is known about the effects that factors such as the bar deformations, strain rate, and strain aging have on the cyclic behavior. The effects of strain aging on the cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel can be very relevant when considering postearthquake retrofitting of reinforced concrete structures. A series of cyclic uniaxial tests were conducted at the University of Canterbury on the two commercially available grades of New Zealand reinforcing steel, where the effects of cyclic loading, bar deformations, strain rate, and strain aging on the stress-strain behavior of reinforcing steel were investigated. The emphasis of the tests was to observe the material behavior, and hence buckling was restricted. The present paper describes the test setup and discusses the results of the investigation.},

abstract = {This paper presents the formulation of a time-dependent seismic fragility format for bridges, as well as new insights into the potential effects of aging and deterioration on seismic vulnerability traditionally neglected in fragility modeling, including joint impacts of multiple component deterioration not investigated to date. The study evaluates the impact of lifetime exposure to chlorides from deicing salts on the seismic performance of multispan continuous highway bridges, considering corrosion of reinforced concrete columns and steel bridge bearings. The components' degradation and their influence on seismic response are illustrated through three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic analysis. A full probabilistic analysis accounting for variation in bridge, ground motion, and corrosion parameters is conducted to develop time-dependent seismic fragility curves. These fragility curves indicate the evolving potential for component and system damage under seismic loading considering time-dependent corrosion-induced deterioration. The results indicate that while corrosion may actually decrease the seismic vulnerability of some components, most critical components suffer an increase in vulnerability. Quadratic models depicting the change in lognormal seismic fragility parameters are proposed to capture the time-dependent effect of aging on the fragility of the bridge system. Overall, the seismic vulnerability significantly increases throughout the lifetime of the representative bridge geometry, with a 32{\%} shift in the median value of complete damage fragility near the end of the bridge's life.},

By performing both accelerated and simulated corrosion tests on bare bars and on bars embedded in concrete, the mechanism of the reduction of the capacity of corroded reinforcement was investigated. The influence of type and diameter of reinforcement on its residual capacity is discussed. The experimental results show that, due to local attack penetration, the residual cross-section of a corroded bar is no longer round and varies considerably along its circumference and its length. Although the force-extension curves of corroded bars are similar to those of non­corroded bars for up to 16{\%} corrosion, their residual yield and ultimate forces decrease more rapidly than their average cross-sectional area and, therefore, their residual strength decreases significantly. Even though the residual capacity of corroded small diameter and/or plain bars reduces more than that of large diameter or ribbed ones, differences are not significant and can be neglected. Finally, a simple equation is proposed to predict the residual capacity of corroded reinforcing bars in practice.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of an investigation on degradation of seismic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) columns damaged by reinforcement corrosion. A total of 13 reinforced concrete circular columns were tested under combined cyclic lateral displacement excursions and constant axial load after being subjected to accelerated corrosion tests. The controlled variables in the test were corrosion level and axial load ratio. The steel corrosion loss ratios ranged from 0{\%} to 15.1{\%}, and the axial load ratios varied from 0.15 to 0.9. Based on the test results, degradation models for loading capacity, stiffness, ductility and energy dissipation capacity of columns were proposed. Test results show that higher corrosion levels and higher axial loads result in less stable hysteretic loops with more severe strength and stiffness degradations and worse ductility, and that the energy dissipation of corroded specimens at the same displacement excursions is approximately the same as that of control specimens, regardless of the corrosion level, when the rebar corrosion loss ratio is less than 14{\%}.},

Root-finding algorithms, time integration methods, constraint handlers, linear equation solvers, and degree of freedom numberers are implemented as interchangeable components using the Strategy pattern. The Bridge and Factory Method patterns allow objects of the finite-element model to vary independently from objects that implement the numerical solution procedures. The Adapter and Iterator patterns permit equations to be assembled entirely through abstract interfaces that do not expose either the storage of objects in the analysis model or the computational details of the time integration method.

abstract = {A new plastic hinge integration method overcomes the problems with nonobjective response caused by strain-softening behavior in force-based beam-column finite elements. The integration method uses the common concept of a plastic hinge length in a numerically consistent manner. The method, derived from the Gauss-Radau quadrature rule, integrates deformations over specified plastic hinge lengths at the ends of the beam-column element, and it has the desirable property that it reduces to the exact solution for linear problems. Numerical examples show the effect of plastic hinge integration on the response of force-based beam-column elements for both strain-hardening and strain-softening section behavior in the plastic hinge regions. The incorporation of a plastic hinge length in the element integration method ensures objective element and section response, which is important for strain-softening behavior in reinforced concrete structures. Plastic rotations are defined in a consistent manner and clearly related to deformations in the plastic hinges.},

abstract = { A stress‐strain model is developed for concrete subjected to uniaxial compressive loading and confined by transverse reinforcement. The concrete section may contain any general type of confining steel: either spiral or circular hoops; or rectangular hoops with or without supplementary cross ties. These cross ties can have either equal or unequal confining stresses along each of the transverse axes. A single equation is used for the stress‐strain equation. The model allows for cyclic loading and includes the effect of strain rate. The influence of various types of confinement is taken into account by defining an effective lateral confining stress, which is dependent on the configuration of the transverse and longitudinal reinforcement. An energy balance approach is used to predict the longitudinal compressive strain in the concrete corresponding to first fracture of the transverse reinforcement by equating the strain energy capacity of the transverse reinforcement to the strain energy stored in the concrete as a result of the confinement.}

abstract = {In flexural concrete members, strain penetration occurs along longitudinal reinforcing bars that are fully anchored into connecting concrete members, causing bar slips along a partial anchoring length and thus end rotations to the flexural members at the connection intersections. Ignoring the strain penetration in linear and nonlinear analyses. of concrete structures will underestimate the deflections and member elongation, and overestimate the stiffness, hysteretic energy dissipation capacities, strains, and section curvature. Focusing on the member end rotation due to strain penetration along reinforcing bars fully anchored in footings and bridge joints, this paper introduces a hysteretic model for the reinforcing bar stress versus slip response that can be integrated into fiber-based analysis of concrete structures using a zero-length section element. The ability of the proposed hysteretic model to capture the strain penetration effects is demonstrated by simulating the measured global and local responses of two concrete columns and a bridge T-joint system. Unless the strain penetration effects are satisfactorily modeled, it is shown that the analysis of concrete structures will appreciably underestimate the local response parameters that are used to quantify structural damage.},

abstract = { The sustained development of computational power continues to promote the use of distributed inelasticity fiber frame models. The current article presents a comprehensive application and discussion of state-of-the-art formulations for the nonlinear material response of reinforced concrete structures. The broad character of the study is imparted by the joint analysis of the effects of the type of formulation (displacement based versus force based), sectional constitutive behavior (hardening versus softening response), and numerical integration parameters (such as quadrature method, mesh definition, or number of integration points). Global and local responses are assessed, along with a critical review of existing regularization techniques. An experimentally tested cantilever is used to conduct the study and illustrate the previous features. The example shows that the convergence of displacement-based meshes under objective response can be much slower than what preceding studies indicate, unlike their force-based counterpart. Additionally, the physical interpretation of the local response under softening behavior supports the proposal of a novel regularization scheme for displacement-based elements, validated through comparison against experimental results. }

An experimental study is underway to assess the performance of 30 circular, well-confined, bridge columns with varying lateral displacement history, transverse reinforcement detailing, axial load, aspect ratio, and longitudinal steel content. Eight of these columns, with similar geometry and detailing, were subjected to various unidirectional displacement histories including standardized laboratory reversed cyclic loading and re-creations of the displacement responses obtained from a nonlinear time-history analysis of multiple earthquakes with distinct characteristics. Longitudinal reinforcing bars were instrumented to obtain strain hysteresis, vertical strain profiles, cross section curvatures, curvature distributions, and fixed-end rotations attributable to strain penetration. Results have shown that the limit state of reinforcement bar buckling was influenced by load history, but the relationship between strain and displacement along the envelope curve was not. The main impact of load history on bar buckling is its influence on accumulated strains within the longitudinal reinforcement and transverse steel. }

For the last 15 years, Tcl has been the primary scripting language to which the model building and analysis modules of OpenSees are linked. To provide users with different scripting language options, particularly Python, the OpenSees interpreter interface was refactored to provide multi-interpreter capabilities. This refactoring, resulting in the creation of OpenSeesPy as a Python module, is accomplished through an abstract interface for interpreter calls with concrete implementations for different scripting languages. Through this approach, users are able to develop applications that utilize the unique features of several scripting languages while taking advantage of advanced finite element analysis models and algorithms.},

Repeated seismic events result in reduced structural capacity and may lead to bridge col- lapse, causing disruption in the normal functioning of transportation networks. This study proposes a framework to predict damage accumulation in structures subjected to multiple shock scenarios after developing damage index prediction models and accounting for the probabilistic nature of the hazard. The versatility of the proposed framework is demonstrated on a case-study highway bridge located in California for two distinct hazard scenarios: (1) multiple main shocks during the service life and (2) multiple aftershock earthquake occurrences follow- ing a single main shock. Results reveal that in both cases there is a significant increase in damage index exceedance probabilities due to repeated shocks within the time window of interest.},

abstract = {Current seismic design of bridges is based on " one-time " performance of the bridges during the design seismic event. However, there might be a considerable probability of observing more than one damaging earthquakes in a bridge's service life. Bridge components are known to accumulate seismic damage and deterioration in their structural properties. In such a scenario, design criteria that account for the cumulative seismic damage of bridges over time and performance objectives that span more than one seismic event are needed. This paper computes the probability of occurrence of more than one damaging earthquake during a bridge's service life. Furthermore, it investigates the importance of accounting for cumulative seismic damage in seismic design. This paper develops a probabilistic model to compute the de-graded deformation capacity of flexural reinforced concrete (RC) bridge columns as a function of cumulative low-cycle fatigue damage incurred in the past earthquakes. The model is developed for flexural RC columns because low-cycle fatigue is most significant for such columns. The proposed model accounts for the degradation in the ultimate curvature capacity and deformation capacity of RC columns associated to low-cycle fatigue. The proposed model is calibrated by using data from cyclic-load analyses of RC columns performed by using the finite element method (FEM). The FEM model accounts for the cracking and pinching of RC sections to properly simulate the degradation process. Finally, the proposed model is used to assess the fragilities of RC bridge columns conditioning on the values of low-cycle fatigue damage and deformation demand. It is found that in seismically active regions there is a significant probability of observing more than one damaging earthquake in a bridge's service life. Therefore, accounting for the cumulative seismic damage in the seismic design is important. It is also found that the cumulative seismic damage can significantly affect the reliability of bridge columns. The developed models are useful for a seismic design that properly accounts for long-term safety and reliability of bridges.},

However, equally important is applying such a methodology to the design of structures. Probabilistic performance-based seismic design enables design and acceptance criteria to be specified by a continuum of limit states and incorporates uncertainty in all the sources of data. This paper introduces a non-iterative method, based on the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center framework, for design of bridge structures in terms of single or multiple physical design parameters, such as column height and diameter. Design parameter solutions are obtained from explicit consideration of uncertainty in the hazard, demand, damage, and loss to the structure by way of specifying a level of confidence in the resulting design under different performance objectives. Similar to other performance-based methodologies, performance objectives consist of a performance level and a hazard level. Design equations are derived for performance levels defined in terms of bridge damage and loss. Examples are presented of both univariate and bivariate design parameter cases for typical reinforced concrete highway overpass bridges in California.},

abstract = {This article presents an explicit cost analysis framework built upon the unified reliability method that introduces time-dependent variables and multiple hazards as well as parameterized demand models into one cost-based limit state function. In this approach, reliability-based design of deteriorating structures subjected to natural hazards is performed using a cost limit state function, as opposed to traditional structural limit state in structural reliability methods. The flexibility of cost-based limit state functions addresses the criticism of focusing on minimization of the total expected cost typically used in some available life-cycle cost analysis methods. Furthermore, the framework has the capability to include deterioration models that are functions of time as well as recently developed parameterized structural capacity and demand models for various hazards. The application of the proposed framework is illustrated in a bridge design optimization problem where the column reinforcement bar diameter and concrete cover are considered as design parameters. Two locations in the New Madrid and San Francisco Bay Area seismic zones are assumed for the bridge and the optimum combination of concrete cover and bar diameter is obtained for each location. {\textcopyright} 2015 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.},

This study addresses this data need by use of a Web-based survey of central and southeastern U.S. Department of Transportation bridge inspectors and officials. Results of the 28 responses are analyzed and offer a link between various types of bridge component damage and the expected level of allowable traffic carrying capacity due to closure decisions and repair procedures. This data is utilized to assess the probability of meeting various damage states, expressed in terms of restoration of functionality, and subsequently facilitate the refinement of component limit-state capacities for analytical fragility curve development. The bridge functionality relationships and methodology outlined serve as the basis for refinement of critical tools in the seismic risk assessment framework and improved assessment of transportation network performance.},

Corrosion may be initiated from the application of de-icing salts or atmospheric exposure in a marine environment. It is assumed that corrosion will lead to a reduction in the cross-sectional area of the reinforcing steel. Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate probabilities of failure for annual increments over the lifetime of the structure (75 years). The application of de-icing salts or atmospheric marine exposure is shown to cause significant long-term deterioration and reduction in structural safety.

In this study, flexural strength loss in concrete bridge beams due to corrosion of steel reinforcement is considered. The sensitivity of the corrosion initiation time of steel reinforcement to changes in the main descriptors of diffusion related random variables is illustrated. Both the mean and standard deviation of the corrosion initiation time increase with an increase in the coefficient of variation of each of the diffusion related random variables for the range of values considered in this study. An example problem is given which illustrates the effect of various variables including corrosion rate and corrosion initiation time on the time-variant area of steel reinforcement and flexural strength of an existing reinforced concrete bridge beam. For the range of parameters and the damage scenarios considered, the mean value of the resistance loss function appears to increase about linearly with time. The results can be used to develop optimal lifetime reliability-based maintenance strategies for reinforced concrete bridges under environmental attack.},

This paper discusses the applicability of statistical inference concepts for fragility function estimation, describes appropriate fitting approaches for use with various structural analysis strategies, and studies how to fit fragility functions while minimizing the required number of structural analyses. Illustrative results show that multiple stripe analysis produces more efficient fragility estimates than incremental dynamic analysis for a given number of structural analyses, provided that some knowledge of the building's capacity is available prior to analysis so that relevant portions of the fragility curve can be approximately identified. This finding has other benefits, given that the multiple stripe analysis approach allows for different ground motions to be used for analyses at varying intensity levels, to represent the differing characteristics of low-intensity and high-intensity shaking. The proposed assessment approach also provides a framework for evaluating alternate analysis procedures that may arise in the future.},

The seismogenic structure consists of a NW-SE elongated fault zone extending for about 40 km. The focal mechanisms of the largest shocks reveal normal faulting with NE-SW extension perpendicular to the trend of the Apennines, consistently with the Quaternary tectonic setting of the internal sector of the belt and with previous earthquakes in adjacent regions. Preliminary data on the main shocks and aftershocks show that extension in this region of the Apennines is accomplished by normal faults dipping at low angle (approx. 40°) to the southwest, and confined in the upper approx. 8 km of the crust. These normal faults might have reactivated thrust planes of the Pliocene compressional tectonics. The aftershock distribution and the damage patterns also suggest that the three main shocks ruptured distinct 5 to 15 km-long fault segments, adjacent and slightly offset from one another.},

Particular attention is given to reconciling the observed spatial distribution of ground motions in terms of physical phenomena related to source, path and site effects. The large number of near-source observed strong ground motions show clear evidence of: forward-directivity, basin generated surface waves, liquefaction and other significant nonlinear site response. The pseudo-acceleration response spectra (SA) amplitudes and significant duration of strong motions agree well with empirical prediction models, except at long vibration periods where the influence of basin-generated surface waves and nonlinear site response are significant and not adequately accounted for in empirical SA models. Pseudo-acceleration response spectra are also compared with those observed in the 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake and routine design response spectra used in order to emphasise the amplitude of ground shaking and elucidate the importance of local geotechnical characteristics on surface ground motions. The characteristics of the observed vertical component accelerations are shown to be strongly dependent on source-to-site distance and are comparable with those from the 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake, implying the large amplitudes observed are simply a result of many observations at close distances rather than a peculiar source effect.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group. Chloride-induced corrosion of highway bridges constitutes a critical form of environmental deterioration and may result in significant escalation of seismic life-cycle costs due to increased fragility during earthquake events. Most of existing literature tends to adopt simplistic uniform area loss assumptions in lieu of potentially complex, yet realistic and more detrimental, pitting corrosion models for seismic vulnerability analysis. Since the degree of deterioration depends on the severity and duration of exposure, there exists a need to investigate the influence of uniform vs. pitting corrosion assumption on seismic life-cycle costs for varied chloride exposure conditions. A case-study example of a highway bridge in Central and Southeastern US reveals consideration of pitting corrosion as critical for extreme exposures compared to relatively minor settings. Subsequently this study provides recommendations to aid bridge engineers and stakeholders to balance between computational cost and accuracy of results to aid prompt decisions on rehabilitation of ageing bridges in different exposure conditions. A framework is also included to compute seismic life-cycle costs from generic measures of corrosion, independent of assumed exposure scenario. This framework is particularly helpful for seismic loss assessment of highway bridges in chloride exposure zones with periodic field measurements to estimate the extent of structural deterioration.},

Since repairing partly damaged structures may not occur immediately, the strain ageing effect can significantly influence the structural behaviour. The changes due to this effect have not so far been considered in the civil engineering design guidelines. In order to investigate strain ageing effects, two-stage experimental tests are carried out on the mild-steel specimens. In the first stage, partial damage is made using quasi-static loading. During the second stage, the strength and ductility of the specimens are examined after 2 and 7days ‘ageing' at room temperature and the results are compared with the corresponding no-age samples. The microstructure of the specimens is examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To illustrate the effect of strain ageing on the global behaviour of steel structures, a numerical example is provided in which strain ageing impacts on loading capacity and deflection of a steel beam. Finally, the stress–strain relation of partially damaged mild-steel material incorporating strain ageing effects is expressed by calibrating the parameters of Ramberg–Osgood model.},

abstract = {The chemical compositions of the pore solutions extracted from seven different cement pastes (one Swedish and one French standard Portland cement, sulfate resistant, blast-furnace slag, fly ash, silica, and high alumina cement) have been determined. Analyses covered Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, and Si as well as pH and Eh (redox potential). Ionic strengths in the range 0.03-0.29 M and pH-values in the range 12.4-13.5 were obtained. Only the pore solutions from the slag cement and the French Portland cement were reducing (negative Eh). The dominating cations of standard Portland, sulfate resistant, slag, silica and fly ash cement pore solutions were Na and K, and in sulfate resistant cement also Ca. The main components in the pore solutions of aluminate cement were Na and Al. The Si and Fe concentrations were low in all pore solutions. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Samples of the capillary pore solution, associated with hardened cement pastes containing various proportions of silica-fume and sodium chloride, have been expressed at different stages of curing and analysed to determine concentrations of dissolved ions. The results indicate that partial replacement of Portland cement by increasing percentages of silica-fume causes a regular decrease in alkalinity of the pore solution and a reduction in the chloride-binding capacity of the material. Possible implications regarding the level of corrosion protection afforded to embedded steel are considered. {\textcopyright} 1983 Bordas-Dunod.},

@article{Cairns2005,
abstract = {Corrosion of embedded reinforcement is the most prevalent form of degradation of reinforced concrete structures, and may impair structural capacity through loss of bar section, loss of bond between reinforcement and concrete as a result of longitudinal cracking, or loss of concrete cross section. The effect of corrosion attack on mechanical properties of reinforcement is investigated through physical tests on bars with simulated and real corrosion damage and through a simple numerical model. Bars subjected to local or pitting attack may suffer a relatively modest loss of strength but a significant loss of ductility, and this is related principally to the variability of attack along the length of the bar. The numerical model supplements experimental work through a parametric study on the influence of steel characteristics. Finally, guidelines on assessment are suggested that are derived from results reported in the paper and from elsewhere in the published literature.},
