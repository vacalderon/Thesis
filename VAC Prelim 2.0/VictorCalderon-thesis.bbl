    A long sequence of earthquakes, six with magnitudes between 5 and 6, struck
  Central Italy starting on September 26, 1997, causing severe damages and loss
  of human lives. The seismogenic structure consists of a NW-SE elongated fault
  zone extending for about 40 km. The focal mechanisms of the largest shocks
  reveal normal faulting with NE-SW extension perpendicular to the trend of the
  Apennines, consistently with the Quaternary tectonic setting of the internal
  sector of the belt and with previous earthquakes in adjacent regions.
  Preliminary data on the main shocks and aftershocks show that extension in
  this region of the Apennines is accomplished by normal faults dipping at low
  angle (approx. 40°) to the southwest, and confined in the upper approx. 8 km
  of the crust. These normal faults might have reactivated thrust planes of the
  Pliocene compressional tectonics. The aftershock distribution and the damage
  patterns also suggest that the three main shocks ruptured distinct 5 to 15
  km-long fault segments, adjacent and slightly offset from one another.%

    The NGA-West2 project database expands on its predecessor to include
  worldwide ground motion data recorded from shallow crustal earthquakes in
  active tectonic regimes post-2000 and a set of small-to-moderate-magnitude
  earthquakes in California between 1998 and 2011. The database includes 21,336
  (mostly) three-component records from 599 events. The parameter space covered
  by the database is M 3.0 to M 7.9, closest distance of 0.05 to 1,533 km, and
  site time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the top 30 m of V S30 ¼ 94 m∕s
  to 2;100 m∕s (although data becomes sparse for distances {\textgreater}400
  km and V S30 {\textgreater} 1;200 m∕s or {\textless}150 m∕s). The
  database includes uniformly processed time series and response spectral
  ordinates for 111 periods ranging from 0.01 s to 20 s at 11 damping ratios.
  Ground motions and metadata for source, path, and site conditions were
  subject to quality checks by ground motion prediction equation developers and
  topical working groups.%

    Estimation of fragility functions using dynamic structural analysis is an
  important step in a number of seismic assessment procedures. This paper
  discusses the applicability of statistical inference concepts for fragility
  function estimation, describes appropriate fitting approaches for use with
  various structural analysis strategies, and studies how to fit fragility
  functions while minimizing the required number of structural analyses.
  Illustrative results show that multiple stripe analysis produces more
  efficient fragility estimates than incremental dynamic analysis for a given
  number of structural analyses, provided that some knowledge of the building's
  capacity is available prior to analysis so that relevant portions of the
  fragility curve can be approximately identified. This finding has other
  benefits, given that the multiple stripe analysis approach allows for
  different ground motions to be used for analyses at varying intensity levels,
  to represent the differing characteristics of low-intensity and
  high-intensity shaking. The proposed assessment approach also provides a
  framework for evaluating alternate analysis procedures that may arise in the
  future.%

    This article presents an explicit cost analysis framework built upon the
  unified reliability method that introduces time-dependent variables and
  multiple hazards as well as parameterized demand models into one cost-based
  limit state function. In this approach, reliability-based design of
  deteriorating structures subjected to natural hazards is performed using a
  cost limit state function, as opposed to traditional structural limit state
  in structural reliability methods. The flexibility of cost-based limit state
  functions addresses the criticism of focusing on minimization of the total
  expected cost typically used in some available life-cycle cost analysis
  methods. Furthermore, the framework has the capability to include
  deterioration models that are functions of time as well as recently developed
  parameterized structural capacity and demand models for various hazards. The
  application of the proposed framework is illustrated in a bridge design
  optimization problem where the column reinforcement bar diameter and concrete
  cover are considered as design parameters. Two locations in the New Madrid
  and San Francisco Bay Area seismic zones are assumed for the bridge and the
  optimum combination of concrete cover and bar diameter is obtained for each
  location. {\textcopyright} 2015 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure

    \field{abstract}{%
    This manuscript provides a critical examination of the ground motions
  recorded in the near-source region resulting from the 22 February 2011
  Christchurch earthquake. Particular attention is given to reconciling the
  observed spatial distribution of ground motions in terms of physical
  phenomena related to source, path and site effects. The large number of
  near-source observed strong ground motions show clear evidence of:
  forward-directivity, basin generated surface waves, liquefaction and other
  significant nonlinear site response. The pseudo-acceleration response spectra
  (SA) amplitudes and significant duration of strong motions agree well with
  empirical prediction models, except at long vibration periods where the
  influence of basin-generated surface waves and nonlinear site response are
  significant and not adequately accounted for in empirical SA models.
  Pseudo-acceleration response spectra are also compared with those observed in
  the 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake and routine design response spectra
  used in order to emphasise the amplitude of ground shaking and elucidate the
  importance of local geotechnical characteristics on surface ground motions.
  The characteristics of the observed vertical component accelerations are
  shown to be strongly dependent on source-to-site distance and are comparable
  with those from the 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake, implying the large
  amplitudes observed are simply a result of many observations at close
  distances rather than a peculiar source effect.%

    The sustained development of computational power continues to promote the
  use of distributed inelasticity fiber frame models. The current article
  presents a comprehensive application and discussion of state-of-the-art
  formulations for the nonlinear material response of reinforced concrete
  structures. The broad character of the study is imparted by the joint
  analysis of the effects of the type of formulation (displacement based versus
  force based), sectional constitutive behavior (hardening versus softening
  response), and numerical integration parameters (such as quadrature method,
  mesh definition, or number of integration points). Global and local responses
  are assessed, along with a critical review of existing regularization
  techniques. An experimentally tested cantilever is used to conduct the study
  and illustrate the previous features. The example shows that the convergence
  of displacement-based meshes under objective response can be much slower than
  what preceding studies indicate, unlike their force-based counterpart.
  Additionally, the physical interpretation of the local response under
  softening behavior supports the proposal of a novel regularization scheme for
  displacement-based elements, validated through comparison against
  experimental results.%

    In this paper, probabilistic drift and shear force capacity models are
  developed for corroding reinforced concrete (RC) columns. The developments
  represent a merger between a probabilistic model for chloride-induced
  corrosion, a time-dependent corrosion rate, and previously developed
  probabilistic models for drift and shear force capacity of pristine
  (undamaged) RC columns. Fragility estimates are obtained for an example
  corroding column by applying the developed models at given shear and drift
  demands. Model uncertainties in both the capacity and corrosion models are
  considered in the fragility estimation, in addition to uncertainties in
  environmental conditions, material properties, and structural geometry.
  Sensitivity analyses of the corroding RC column are carried out to identify
  the parameters to which the reliability of the example column is most
  sensitive. The developed models consider different combinations of chloride
  exposure condition, environmental oxygen availability, water-to-cement
  ratios, and curing conditions. They are applicable to both existing and new
  RC columns and may be employed for the prediction of service-life and
  life-cycle cost analysis of RC structures.%

    This paper presents an experimental investigation into the residual
  capacity of corroded reinforcing bars. By performing both accelerated and
  simulated corrosion tests on bare bars and on bars embedded in concrete, the
  mechanism of the reduction of the capacity of corroded reinforcement was
  investigated. The influence of type and diameter of reinforcement on its
  residual capacity is discussed. The experimental results show that, due to
  local attack penetration, the residual cross-section of a corroded bar is no
  longer round and varies considerably along its circumference and its length.
  Although the force-extension curves of corroded bars are similar to those of
  non­corroded bars for up to 16{\%} corrosion, their residual yield and
  ultimate forces decrease more rapidly than their average cross-sectional area
  and, therefore, their residual strength decreases significantly. Even though
  the residual capacity of corroded small diameter and/or plain bars reduces
  more than that of large diameter or ribbed ones, differences are not
  significant and can be neglected. Finally, a simple equation is proposed to
  predict the residual capacity of corroded reinforcing bars in practice.%

    Bridges subjected to environmental attack can experience changes in
  resistance which are time-variant. In this study, flexural strength loss in
  concrete bridge beams due to corrosion of steel reinforcement is considered.
  The sensitivity of the corrosion initiation time of steel reinforcement to
  changes in the main descriptors of diffusion related random variables is
  illustrated. Both the mean and standard deviation of the corrosion initiation
  time increase with an increase in the coefficient of variation of each of the
  diffusion related random variables for the range of values considered in this
  study. An example problem is given which illustrates the effect of various
  variables including corrosion rate and corrosion initiation time on the
  time-variant area of steel reinforcement and flexural strength of an existing
  reinforced concrete bridge beam. For the range of parameters and the damage
  scenarios considered, the mean value of the resistance loss function appears
  to increase about linearly with time. The results can be used to develop
  optimal lifetime reliability-based maintenance strategies for reinforced
  concrete bridges under environmental attack.%

    Electrochemical measurements of chloride thresholds are reported in
  simulated concrete pore solution for as-received and surface-modified rebar
  in an experimental apparatus designed to simulate service conditions. Surface
  modification led to higher chloride thresholds and reduced variability. The
  variability in thresholds for as-received rebar was represented by a
  log-normal distribution; therefore, simple averages of chloride thresholds,
  without reference to underlying distribution, might not provide reliable
  indicators of depassivation. The relative constancy of electrochemical
  measurements below thresholds, and the dependence of the thresholds on
  surface conditions, suggests that rebar depassivation is likely caused by

    This paper presents the formulation of a time-dependent seismic fragility
  format for bridges, as well as new insights into the potential effects of
  aging and deterioration on seismic vulnerability traditionally neglected in
  fragility modeling, including joint impacts of multiple component
  deterioration not investigated to date. The study evaluates the impact of
  lifetime exposure to chlorides from deicing salts on the seismic performance
  of multispan continuous highway bridges, considering corrosion of reinforced
  concrete columns and steel bridge bearings. The components' degradation and
  their influence on seismic response are illustrated through three-dimensional
  nonlinear dynamic analysis. A full probabilistic analysis accounting for
  variation in bridge, ground motion, and corrosion parameters is conducted to
  develop time-dependent seismic fragility curves. These fragility curves
  indicate the evolving potential for component and system damage under seismic
  loading considering time-dependent corrosion-induced deterioration. The
  results indicate that while corrosion may actually decrease the seismic
  vulnerability of some components, most critical components suffer an increase
  in vulnerability. Quadratic models depicting the change in lognormal seismic
  fragility parameters are proposed to capture the time-dependent effect of
  aging on the fragility of the bridge system. Overall, the seismic
  vulnerability significantly increases throughout the lifetime of the
  representative bridge geometry, with a 32{\%} shift in the median value of
  complete damage fragility near the end of the bridge's life.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Civil infrastructures, such as highway bridges, located in seismically
  active regions are often subjected to multiple earthquakes, including
  multiple main shocks during their service life or main shock–aftershock
  sequences. Repeated seismic events result in reduced structural capacity and
  may lead to bridge col- lapse, causing disruption in the normal functioning
  of transportation networks. This study proposes a framework to predict damage
  accumulation in structures subjected to multiple shock scenarios after
  developing damage index prediction models and accounting for the
  probabilistic nature of the hazard. The versatility of the proposed framework
  is demonstrated on a case-study highway bridge located in California for two
  distinct hazard scenarios: (1) multiple main shocks during the service life
  and (2) multiple aftershock earthquake occurrences follow- ing a single main
  shock. Results reveal that in both cases there is a significant increase in
  damage index exceedance probabilities due to repeated shocks within the time
  window of interest.%

    Described in this paper are strain limit states for reinforced concrete

    In this paper, the importance of displacement history and its effects on
  performance limit states, the relationship between strain and displacement,
  and the spread of plasticity in RC structures is explored. An experimental
  study is underway to assess the performance of 30 circular, well-confined,
  bridge columns with varying lateral displacement history, transverse
  reinforcement detailing, axial load, aspect ratio, and longitudinal steel
  content. Eight of these columns, with similar geometry and detailing, were
  subjected to various unidirectional displacement histories including
  standardized laboratory reversed cyclic loading and re-creations of the
  displacement responses obtained from a nonlinear time-history analysis of
  multiple earthquakes with distinct characteristics. Longitudinal reinforcing
  bars were instrumented to obtain strain hysteresis, vertical strain profiles,
  cross section curvatures, curvature distributions, and fixed-end rotations
  attributable to strain penetration. Results have shown that the limit state
  of reinforcement bar buckling was influenced by load history, but the
  relationship between strain and displacement along the envelope curve was
  not. The main impact of load history on bar buckling is its influence on
  accumulated strains within the longitudinal reinforcement and transverse
  steel.%

    Knowledge of the inelastic displacement ratio, i.e. the ratio of the
  maximum inelastic to the maximum elastic displacement of an SDOF system,
  allows the computation of its maximum inelastic displacement directly from
  the corresponding elastic one. This paper presents a simple and effective
  method for the inelastic displacement ratio estimation of a structure under
  repeated or multiple earthquakes. Extensive parametric studies are conducted
  to obtain expressions for this ratio, in terms of the period of vibration,
  the viscous damping ratio, the strain-hardening ratio, the force reduction
  factor and the soil class. It is found that the repeated earthquakes
  phenomenon has a significant effect on the inelastic displacement ratio and
  hence on the maximum inelastic displacement of SDOF systems. {\textcopyright}

    This paper addresses the strain ageing effects on the mechanical properties
  of the partially damaged structural mild steel. Since repairing partly
  damaged structures may not occur immediately, the strain ageing effect can
  significantly influence the structural behaviour. The changes due to this
  effect have not so far been considered in the civil engineering design
  guidelines. In order to investigate strain ageing effects, two-stage
  experimental tests are carried out on the mild-steel specimens. In the first
  stage, partial damage is made using quasi-static loading. During the second
  stage, the strength and ductility of the specimens are examined after 2 and
  7days ‘ageing' at room temperature and the results are compared with the
  corresponding no-age samples. The microstructure of the specimens is examined
  using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To illustrate the effect of strain
  ageing on the global behaviour of steel structures, a numerical example is
  provided in which strain ageing impacts on loading capacity and deflection of
  a steel beam. Finally, the stress–strain relation of partially damaged
  mild-steel material incorporating strain ageing effects is expressed by
  calibrating the parameters of Ramberg–Osgood model.%

    In this paper chloride ingress in cement paste and mortar is followed by
  electron probe microanalysis. The influence of several paste and exposure
  parameters on chloride ingress are examined (e.g., water-cement ratio, silica

  on Fick's law modified by a term for chloride binding. Inclusion of chloride
  binding significantly improves the profile shape of the modelled ingress

  A new damage index based on ductility and stiffness degradation is proposed.

    \field{abstract}{%
    This paper presents the results of an investigation on degradation of
  seismic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) columns damaged by
  reinforcement corrosion. A total of 13 reinforced concrete circular columns
  were tested under combined cyclic lateral displacement excursions and
  constant axial load after being subjected to accelerated corrosion tests. The
  controlled variables in the test were corrosion level and axial load ratio.
  The steel corrosion loss ratios ranged from 0{\%} to 15.1{\%}, and the axial
  load ratios varied from 0.15 to 0.9. Based on the test results, degradation
  models for loading capacity, stiffness, ductility and energy dissipation
  capacity of columns were proposed. Test results show that higher corrosion
  levels and higher axial loads result in less stable hysteretic loops with
  more severe strength and stiffness degradations and worse ductility, and that
  the energy dissipation of corroded specimens at the same displacement
  excursions is approximately the same as that of control specimens, regardless
  of the corrosion level, when the rebar corrosion loss ratio is less than
  14{\%}.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Recent efforts in the earthquake engineering community have focused largely
  on developing a performancebased earthquake engineering assessment
  methodology. However, equally important is applying such a methodology to the
  design of structures. Probabilistic performance-based seismic design enables
  design and acceptance criteria to be specified by a continuum of limit states
  and incorporates uncertainty in all the sources of data. This paper
  introduces a non-iterative method, based on the Pacific Earthquake
  Engineering Research Center framework, for design of bridge structures in
  terms of single or multiple physical design parameters, such as column height
  and diameter. Design parameter solutions are obtained from explicit
  consideration of uncertainty in the hazard, demand, damage, and loss to the
  structure by way of specifying a level of confidence in the resulting design
  under different performance objectives. Similar to other performance-based
  methodologies, performance objectives consist of a performance level and a
  hazard level. Design equations are derived for performance levels defined in
  terms of bridge damage and loss. Examples are presented of both univariate
  and bivariate design parameter cases for typical reinforced concrete highway
  overpass bridges in California.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    A stress‐strain model is developed for concrete subjected to uniaxial
  compressive loading and confined by transverse reinforcement. The concrete
  section may contain any general type of confining steel: either spiral or
  circular hoops; or rectangular hoops with or without supplementary cross
  ties. These cross ties can have either equal or unequal confining stresses
  along each of the transverse axes. A single equation is used for the
  stress‐strain equation. The model allows for cyclic loading and includes
  the effect of strain rate. The influence of various types of confinement is
  taken into account by defining an effective lateral confining stress, which
  is dependent on the configuration of the transverse and longitudinal
  reinforcement. An energy balance approach is used to predict the longitudinal
  compressive strain in the concrete corresponding to first fracture of the
  transverse reinforcement by equating the strain energy capacity of the
  transverse reinforcement to the strain energy stored in the concrete as a
  result of the confinement.%

    Object composition offers significant advantages over class inheritance to
  develop a flexible software architecture for finite-element analysis. Using
  this approach, separate classes encapsulate fundamental finite-element
  algorithms and interoperate to form and solve the governing nonlinear
  equations. Communication between objects in the analysis composition is
  established using software design patterns. Root-finding algorithms, time
  integration methods, constraint handlers, linear equation solvers, and degree
  of freedom numberers are implemented as interchangeable components using the
  Strategy pattern. The Bridge and Factory Method patterns allow objects of the
  finite-element model to vary independently from objects that implement the
  numerical solution procedures. The Adapter and Iterator patterns permit
  equations to be assembled entirely through abstract interfaces that do not
  expose either the storage of objects in the analysis model or the
  computational details of the time integration method. Sequence diagrams
  document the interoperability of the analysis classes for solving nonlinear
  finite-element equations, demonstrating that object composition with design
  patterns provides a general approach to developing and refactoring nonlinear
  finite-element software. {\textcopyright} 2010 ASCE.%

    Corrosion of reinforcement is one of the leading causes of the
  deterioration in reinforced concrete structures. RC structures damaged by
  reinforcement corrosion can exhibit not only reduction of the bearing
  capacity but also an alteration of the collapse mechanism with a reduction of
  the structural ductility. In order to study the problem, full scale
  experimental tests on column specimens have been performed under cyclic
  loads. Preliminary tests for the calibration of the corrosion process have
  been carried out both on bare and embedded bars. The results of the cyclic
  experimental tests show how the reinforce ment corrosion can lead to a
  reduction of the structural ductility, such that it could become a critical
  aspect particularly for buildings in seismic regions%

    Before ASTM A706 grade 80 rebar may be specified in the seismic design of
  structures, its mechanical properties must be well understood and calibrated
  on a statistical basis. Based on the results of 788 tensile tests of A706
  grade 80 rebar encompassing bar sizes No. 4–No. 18 (approx. metric No.
  13–No. 57), five major stress-strain parameters are statistically evaluated
  and used to develop recommendations for an expected monotonic stress-strain
  curve. An existing material model is shown to accurately capture the shape of
  the monotonic stress-strain curve. Additional tests are used to evaluate the
  strain-aging performance of the steel.%

    Relationships between bridge damage and the resulting loss of functionality

  utilized to assess the probability of meeting various damage states,

  facilitate the refinement of component limit-state capacities for analytical

    A reasonable understanding of the cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel is
  required to accurately estimate the performance of reinforced concrete
  members subjected to cyclic deformations beyond the elastic range such as
  those expected from large earthquakes. Although the cyclic behavior of
  reinforcing steel has been extensively studied, very little is known about
  the effects that factors such as the bar deformations, strain rate, and
  strain aging have on the cyclic behavior. The effects of strain aging on the
  cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel can be very relevant when considering
  postearthquake retrofitting of reinforced concrete structures. A series of
  cyclic uniaxial tests were conducted at the University of Canterbury on the
  two commercially available grades of New Zealand reinforcing steel, where the
  effects of cyclic loading, bar deformations, strain rate, and strain aging on
  the stress-strain behavior of reinforcing steel were investigated. The
  emphasis of the tests was to observe the material behavior, and hence
  buckling was restricted. The present paper describes the test setup and
  discusses the results of the investigation.%

    A new plastic hinge integration method overcomes the problems with
  nonobjective response caused by strain-softening behavior in force-based
  beam-column finite elements. The integration method uses the common concept
  of a plastic hinge length in a numerically consistent manner. The method,
  derived from the Gauss-Radau quadrature rule, integrates deformations over
  specified plastic hinge lengths at the ends of the beam-column element, and
  it has the desirable property that it reduces to the exact solution for
  linear problems. Numerical examples show the effect of plastic hinge
  integration on the response of force-based beam-column elements for both
  strain-hardening and strain-softening section behavior in the plastic hinge
  regions. The incorporation of a plastic hinge length in the element
  integration method ensures objective element and section response, which is
  important for strain-softening behavior in reinforced concrete structures.
  Plastic rotations are defined in a consistent manner and clearly related to
  deformations in the plastic hinges.%

    {\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis
  Group. Chloride-induced corrosion of highway bridges constitutes a critical
  form of environmental deterioration and may result in significant escalation
  of seismic life-cycle costs due to increased fragility during earthquake
  events. Most of existing literature tends to adopt simplistic uniform area
  loss assumptions in lieu of potentially complex, yet realistic and more
  detrimental, pitting corrosion models for seismic vulnerability analysis.
  Since the degree of deterioration depends on the severity and duration of
  exposure, there exists a need to investigate the influence of uniform vs.
  pitting corrosion assumption on seismic life-cycle costs for varied chloride
  exposure conditions. A case-study example of a highway bridge in Central and
  Southeastern US reveals consideration of pitting corrosion as critical for
  extreme exposures compared to relatively minor settings. Subsequently this
  study provides recommendations to aid bridge engineers and stakeholders to
  balance between computational cost and accuracy of results to aid prompt
  decisions on rehabilitation of ageing bridges in different exposure
  conditions. A framework is also included to compute seismic life-cycle costs
  from generic measures of corrosion, independent of assumed exposure scenario.
  This framework is particularly helpful for seismic loss assessment of highway
  bridges in chloride exposure zones with periodic field measurements to
  estimate the extent of structural deterioration.%

    A structural deterioration reliability model is developed to calculate
  probabilities of structural failure (flexure) for a typical reinforced
  concrete continuous slab bridge. Corrosion may be initiated from the
  application of de-icing salts or atmospheric exposure in a marine
  environment. It is assumed that corrosion will lead to a reduction in the
  cross-sectional area of the reinforcing steel. Monte Carlo simulation is used
  to calculate probabilities of failure for annual increments over the lifetime
  of the structure (75 years). The application of de-icing salts or atmospheric
  marine exposure is shown to cause significant long-term deterioration and
  reduction in structural safety. Reducing the cover from that currently
  specified for design results in a significant increase in failure
  probabilities. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

    This paper presents a parametric study on the inelastic response of
  six-story reinforced concrete (RC) frames subjected to main
  shock–aftershock (MS-AS) ground motions. For this purpose, one bare frame
  (BF) and four masonry RC frames with two infill thicknesses (75 mm or 125 mm)
  and two infill patterns (open ground story or fully infilled) are considered.
  They are situated at site class C in Vancouver, Canada, and are designed for
  office occupancy according to the 2005 National Building Code of Canada. The
  five frames are subjected to 100 ensembles of MS-AS ground motions scaled to
  seismic hazard level corre- sponding to the return period of 2,500 years. For
  each sequence of earthquakes, change in the fundamental period (T1) and
  inter-story drift (ISD) for both MS-AS sequences are quantified. The analysis
  results show that the period change and ISD were significant for BF, whereas
  the infilled frames sustained small damage with negligible change in T1.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is a parametric analysis method that has
  recently emerged in several different forms to estimate more thoroughly
  structural performance under seismic loads. It involves subjecting a
  structural model to one (or more) ground motion record(s), each scaled to
  multiple levels of intensity, thus producing one (or more) curve(s) of
  response parameterized versus intensity level. To establish a common frame of
  reference, the fundamental concepts are analysed, a unified terminology is
  proposed, suitable algorithms are presented, and properties of the IDA curve
  are looked into for both single-degree-of-freedom and multi-degree-of-freedom
  structures. In addition, summarization techniques for multi-record IDA
  studies and the association of the IDA study with the conventional static
  pushover analysis and the yield reduction R-factor are discussed. Finally, in
  the framework of performance-based earthquake engineering, the assessment of
  demand and capacity is viewed through the lens of an IDA study.

    A structural deterioration reliability (probabilistic) model has been used
  herein to calculate probabilities of structural failure. New reinforced
  concrete corrosion initiation, corrosion rate and time-variant load models
  are proposed. Three durability design specifications are considered in a
  lifetime reliability analysis of a RC slab bridge. Time-variant increases in
  loads are considered also. It was found that the application of de-icing
  salts causes significant long-term deterioration and reduction in structural
  safety for poor durability design specifications. A reduced cover or
  increased water-cement ratio increases failure probabilities. When compared
  to the case of “no deterioration”, it was observed also that the
  probability of failure only marginally increased for good durability design
  specifications. The approaches described herein are relevant to other
  physical infrastructure also.%

    Modeling the Time-to-Corrosion Cracking in Chloride Contaminated Reinforced
  Concrete Structures Document Name: 95-M65 Author(s): Youping Liu and Richard
  E. Weyers Publication: Materials Journal Volume: 95 Issue: 6 Pages: 675-680
  Keywords: chloride-induced corrosion; concrete; corrosion cracking model;
  time-to-cracking Date: November 1, 1998 Abstract: The time to cracking, from
  corrosion initiation to cracking of the reinforcing steel cover concrete, is
  one of the critical time periods for modeling the time to repair,
  rehabilitate and replace reinforced concrete structures in corrosive
  environments. The time-to-corrosion cracking was experimentally determined
  from simulated bridge deck slabs. The experimental design considered
  corrosion rate, concrete cover depth, reinforcing steel bar spacing and size.
  Three, of the 14 slab series, cracked during the 5 year study. Metal loss was
  determined for the cracked specimens which had cover depths of 1, 2, and 3
  in. (25, 51, and 76 mm). A time-to-corrosion cracking model was developed
  considering the critical amount of corrosion products which consists of the
  amount of corrosion products needed to fill the interconnected void space
  around the reinforcing bar plus the amount of corrosion products needed to
  generate sufficient tensile stresses to crack the cover concrete. The
  experimentally observed time to cracking is in good agreement with the model
  predicted time to cracking.%

    The reinforced concrete (RC) columns infiltrated by chloride ion in marine
  environment are much vulner- able under seismic loading. In this paper, the
  hysteretic behaviors of corroded RC columns were studied, which were
  considered as the condition of tide region or splash zone. Experiments were
  designed for five groups of corroded RC columns with different maximum
  amounts of corrosion of rebar under cyclic lat- eral loads combined with a
  constant vertical load. The traditional soaking method was replaced by a new
  wrapping method in order to obtain the desired amount of corrosion of rebar
  that was similar with the environment condition. The results showed that the
  flexural strength, the circular stiffness, the ductility, and the energy
  absorption of corroded RC column degraded with the increase of the maximum
  amount of corrosion of rebar. The maximum amount of corrosion of 13.25{\%}
  and the dilation crack width of 1.2 mm were two important critical
  parameters.%

    A model for evaluating structural damage in reinforced concrete structures

    \field{abstract}{%
    Corrosion damage is one of the main problems affecting the durability of
  concrete structures. Several corroded reinforced concrete (RC) railway
  bridges are located in regions of high seismic risk. Corroded bridge piers
  are often subjected to dynamic axial loads, such as the vertical pounding
  that occurs during earthquakes or due to railway trains. Repeated axial
  loading was used to simulate this vertical pounding effect. Therefore, the
  seismic performance of corroded RC structures under repeated axial and
  horizontal cyclic loading is an urgent issue. To investigate the influences
  of steel corrosion and repeated axial loading on the seismic performance of a
  column pier, eight RC column speci-mens were experimentally investigated. The
  results indicated that corrosion significantly influences the yield strength
  and load bearing capacity of a column. The load bearing capacities of the
  corroded specimens decreased by 18.27{\%} compared with noncorroded specimens
  when the longitudinal loss of steel mass was 7.16{\%}. Repeated axial loading
  did not significantly influence the mechanical properties of the cor-roded RC
  piers. Cyclic tests were performed to validate a finite-element model that
  was used to assess the effects of corrosion level on the seis-mic performance
  of columns. The level of steel corrosion ranged from 0 to 28{\%}. According
  to the finite-element analysis, the yield strength (35{\%}) and ultimate
  displacement (34{\%}) decreased with increasing corrosion.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In flexural concrete members, strain penetration occurs along longitudinal
  reinforcing bars that are fully anchored into connecting concrete members,
  causing bar slips along a partial anchoring length and thus end rotations to
  the flexural members at the connection intersections. Ignoring the strain
  penetration in linear and nonlinear analyses. of concrete structures will
  underestimate the deflections and member elongation, and overestimate the
  stiffness, hysteretic energy dissipation capacities, strains, and section
  curvature. Focusing on the member end rotation due to strain penetration
  along reinforcing bars fully anchored in footings and bridge joints, this
  paper introduces a hysteretic model for the reinforcing bar stress versus
  slip response that can be integrated into fiber-based analysis of concrete
  structures using a zero-length section element. The ability of the proposed
  hysteretic model to capture the strain penetration effects is demonstrated by
  simulating the measured global and local responses of two concrete columns
  and a bridge T-joint system. Unless the strain penetration effects are
  satisfactorily modeled, it is shown that the analysis of concrete structures
  will appreciably underestimate the local response parameters that are used to
  quantify structural damage.%

    OpenSees, an open source finite element software framework, has been used
  broadly in the earthquake engineering community for simulating the seismic
  response of structural and geotechnical systems. The framework allows users
  to perform finite element analysis with a scripting language and for
  developers to create both serial and parallel finite element computer
  applications as interpreters. For the last 15 years, Tcl has been the primary
  scripting language to which the model building and analysis modules of
  OpenSees are linked. To provide users with different scripting language
  options, particularly Python, the OpenSees interpreter interface was
  refactored to provide multi-interpreter capabilities. This refactoring,
  resulting in the creation of OpenSeesPy as a Python module, is accomplished
  through an abstract interface for interpreter calls with concrete
  implementations for different scripting languages. Through this approach,
  users are able to develop applications that utilize the unique features of
  several scripting languages while taking advantage of advanced finite element
  analysis models and algorithms.%
