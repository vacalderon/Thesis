\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{chap-two}

Bridges are designed based on discrete events assuming that the initial material and structure properties remain constant through the bridge's life. The purpose of the research described is to study condition-dependent performance-based design that considers the material and geometric properties as the structure ages and the effects of multiple and discrete events on the achievement of prescribed limit states.

This chapter presents the current knowledge of the aging of structures, damage indexes, corrosion, and multiple earthquake loading. Then the study gap and the objectives of this research are defined.

\section{Corrosion}

Corrosion is one of the main aging effects in RC structures. In RC structures, after the concrete is cast, a protective layer forms on the surface of the reinforcing steel. This process is known as the passivation of the reinforcing steel. However, the protective film can be broken under conditions such as chloride attack. This process is known as depassivation. The depassivation process leads to corrosion. Corrosion reduces the steel area and modifies the effective strength of the reinforcing steel. If corrosion degrades the structural performance of the reinforcing steel, it will certainly degrade the overall strength of the system. The incidence of corrosion in RC structures in earthquake-prone areas could trigger the earliest onset of limit states, such as bar buckling or fractures (compared to pristine conditions). Therefore, it is important to incorporate corrosion mechanics in this condition-dependent performance-based seismic design. The general chloride attack corrosion process can be explained using three main parameters such as (1) time to initiation of corrosion, (2) corrosion growth in reinforcing steel, and (3) the mechanical properties of corroded reinforcing steel. Figure \ref{fig:corr1} schematically shows the corrosion process.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Time to corrosion}

 Jensen et al. performed a series of experiments to measure the chloride ingress in the cement and mortar paste  \cite{Jensen1999}. In their study, it was determined that the ingress of chlorides follows Fick's law of diffusion, shown in \eref{eq:ficks_law}. Stewart et al solved \eref{eq:ficks_law}  in terms of the chloride ion concentration ($C(x,t)$), distance from concrete surface ($x$), time of exposure to chloride ions ($t$), and the chloride diffusion coefficient ($D_c$). The solution rendered equation \eref{eq.three} which describes the time to initiation of corrosion    \cite{Stewart1998}\cite{Y.Liu1998a}\cite{Thoft-Christensen}. Mean values for $C_0$ and $C_r$ have been previously defined for environments that are controlled by deicing salts \cite{Ghosh2010}\cite{Weyers1994}\cite{Enright1998}.

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial C(x,t)}{\partial t} = D_c \frac{\partial C(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
	\label{eq:ficks_law}
\end{equation}
\newline
\begin{equation}
  T_{corr}=\frac{x^2}{4 D_c} \left[erf^{-1} \left(\frac{C_0-C_{cr}}{C_0} \right) \right]^{-2}
  \label{eq.three}
\end{equation} 

\subsection{Rate of corrosion}

Vu et al. developed an empirical model to evaluate the corrosion rate \cite{Vu2000}\cite{Stewart1998}. In their study, a constant corrosion rate was assumed. However, it is known that the corrosion rate is not constant over time because it is dependent on factors such as the quality of concrete, the amount of oxygen available in the environment, and relative humidity. Nonetheless, for long-term studies, this approximation is valid. The underlying assumptions of this model are a relative humidity of 75\% and a temperature of 20°C. The model developed by Vu et al. is shown in \eref{eq.CorrosionRate}. Figure \ref{fig:hist1} shows the corrosion rate for different concrete covers ($d_c$), as a function of the water to cement ratio ($w/c$). In general, for large values of cover depth, the rate of corrosion decreases rapidly, and as the water to cement ratio (i.e., lower quality concrete) increases, the rate of corrosion increases.

\begin{equation}
  i_{corr}=\frac{37.5(1-w/c)}{d_c}
  \label{eq.CorrosionRate}
\end{equation} 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Chapter-2/figs/wc_icor}
\caption{Concrete water to cement ratio vs rate of corrosion}
\label{fig:hist1}
\end{figure}

In addition, Vu et al  further improved the model of corrosion growth in reinforcing steel developed by Stewart et al \cite{Vu2000}\cite{Stewart1998}\cite{Choe2008}\cite{Ghosh2010}. Their proposed model describes the reduction in diameter of reinforcing steel ($d_{corr}(t)$ as a function of time described in \eref{eq.CorrosionEvolution}. Figure \ref{fig:DiameterEvolution} shows this model applied to a rebar with an initial diameter ($d_{bi}$) of 3/4 inch, a concrete cover of 1-1/2”, and water to cement ratios ranging from 0.36-0.50.

\begin{equation}
  d_{corr}(t)=d_{bi}-\frac{1.0508(1-w/c)}{d_c} (t-t_{corr})^{0.71}
  \label{eq.CorrosionEvolution}
\end{equation} 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Chapter-2/figs/DiameterDecrease}
\caption{Diameter decrease due to corrosion}
\label{fig:DiameterEvolution}
\end{figure}

Further, the evolution of corrosion in reinforcing steel can be expressed in the percent loss of mass of rebar. If uniform corrosion is assumed, this can be expressed as the percentage of diameter reduction. The corrosion level can be expressed as shown in \eref{eq.CorrosionLevel}.

\begin{equation}
	CL=\frac{d_{bi}-d_{corr}(t)}{d_{bi}}*100%
  \label{eq.CorrosionLevel}
\end{equation} 

Combining \eref{eq.CorrosionEvolution} with \eref{eq.CorrosionLevel},  the variation of the corrosion level can be described as a function of time. Figure  \ref{fig:CorrosionLevel_Time} shows the results of this process.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Chapter-2/figs/CorrosionLevel}
\caption{Corrosion level vs time (years)}
\label{fig:CorrosionLevel_Time}
\end{figure}

\subsection{corrosion modified properties of reinforcing steel bars}

Du et al. \cite{Du2005}\cite{Du2005b} performed tension tests on corroded rebars and determined that the mechanical properties of steel change with the level of corrosion. In general, as corrosion increases, the reinforcing steel's yield strength, and ultimate strength decrease. The variation of the mechanical properties is shown in \eref{eq.eleven} for the yield strength and ultimate strength of the reinforcing steel.

\begin{equation}
  f_{y,CL}=f_{yo}(1-0.005CL)
  \label{eq.eleven}
\end{equation} 
\[
  f_{u,CL}=f_{uo}(1.018-0.005CL)
\]

One of the limitations of their study is that the accelerated corrosion process used to develop the corrosion in the rebars did not account for the depassivation process that naturally occurs in rebars embedded in concrete. Chapter \ref{chap-three} shows a proposed experimental assessment that will provide an accurate evaluation of the mechanical properties of corroded reinforcing steel. 

\subsection{Physical test on corroded RC Structures}

Recent studies \cite{Ma2012}, \cite{Meda2014} and \cite{Yang2016} have been developed to assess the effect of corrosion on the structural performance of cantilever RC columns. These columns were subjected to accelerated corrosion to obtain different levels ($CL$). The range of $CL$ for these studies corresponds to $CL=0\%-20\%$. In these studies, the accelerated corrosion was performed via an electrochemical process directly applied to the reinforcing steel as shown in \fref{fig:Meda_RC_CorrosionProc}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Chapter-3/figs/Meda_Corrosion}
	\caption{Force displacement response of RC corroded columns \cite{Meda2014}}
	\label{fig:Meda_RC_CorrosionProc}
\end{figure}

The corroded RC columns were then subjected to a quasi-static loading protocol. The resulting force-displacement response of one of these experiments is shown in \fref{fig:Meda_FD}. Again, it can be seen that there is a reduction in the strength and displacement capacity of the system. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Chapter-3/figs/Meda_F-D_01}
	\caption{Corrosion process for RC column \cite{Meda2014}}
	\label{fig:Meda_FD}
\end{figure}

As stated in the previous section, the mechanical properties of steel are affected by corrosion. Therefore, in the previous studies \cite{Meda2014} the authors performed tension tests on corroded reinforcing steel. In these tests, a reduction in the mechanical properties of steel was observed as well as a reduction in the rupture strain $\varepsilon_{srup}$, see \fref{fig:Meda_RebarTest}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Chapter-3/figs/Meda_StressStrain}
	\caption{Corroded rebars stress-strain curves \cite{Meda2014}}
	\label{fig:Meda_RebarTest}
\end{figure}

While these studies show how corroded RC columns behave under cyclic loading, they did not consider the protective film's generation due to the concrete's alkaline environment. This film can modify the mechanical properties of corroded steel. In addition, the accelerated corrosion process used a 3\% $NaCl$ concentration solution, while the chloride attack in concrete usually has a 1.0\% - 1.5\% concentration of the same chloride. Therefore the results obtained from these studies do not accurately represent the actual conditions of corroded RC columns. Thus, an experimental campaign is proposed to provide results on the mechanical behavior of corroded reinforcing steel inside concrete. The experimental campaign is discussed in Chapter \ref{chap-three}.

\section{Steel strain aging}

While corrosion is an important parameter that affects steel in structures, strain aging is a phenomenon that affects mild steel, which is common in older structures. Strain aging is when steel, after being subjected to large strains and an amount of time passes after the loading, when the steel is reloaded. As a result, it presents a higher strength and reduced ductility than before the first loading. Therefore, incorporating this parameter in this research will help evaluate this effect in older structures when subjected to repeated earthquake loading. This process is explained in more detail in this section.

\subsection{Metallurgical process}

It is generally accepted that strain aging is due to the diffusion of carbon and nitrogen atoms in solution to dislocations that have been generated by plastic deformation. Initially, an atmosphere of carbon and nitrogen atoms is formed along the dislocation length, immobilizing it. Extended aging, however, results in sufficient carbon and nitrogen atoms for precipitates to form along the length of the dislocation\cite{Overby2017}\cite{Hosseini2015}.

These precipitates impede the motion of subsequent dislocations and result in some hardening and loss of ductility. The extent of strain aging, a thermally activated process, depends primarily on aging time and temperature. In general, extended aging results in a saturation value above which further aging has no effect \cite{Restrepo-Posada1994}.

A second strengthening mechanism occurs when cold deformation (alone) is applied to steels. When dislocations break away from their pinning interstitial atoms and begin the movement causing slip, they begin to intersect with each other. A complex series of interactions between the dislocations occur, causing them to pin each other, decreasing their mobility and resulting in higher strength, lower ductility, and lower toughness. As a result, cold deformed steels already have lowered ductility and toughness before any strain aging occurs. When heating follows cold deformation, the loss in ductility and toughness is more significant. It is this combination of events that is the most damaging to the toughness of structural steels \cite{Momtahan2009}.

\subsection{Strain aging effects in structures}

Strain aging is how steel subjected to large strains develops an increased strength and reduced ductility with time. Large earthquakes can cause this effect on structures built with mild steel. Therefore, it is vital to include strain aging in a time-dependent analysis. Furthermore, strain aging will cause an increase in the strength of the plastic hinge, and as a consequence, plastic hinges may form in regions of the structures that have not been designed for such demands. The effects of strain aging may also alter the transverse reinforcement due to cold bending, making them susceptible to brittle failure\cite{Momtahan2009}.

According to Restrepo-Posada\cite{Restrepo-Posada1994}, most strain aging occurs in the first 37 days. In addition, Monahan et al. \cite{Momtahan2009} studied strain aging effects concerning the time at different levels of pre-strains. The pre-strains ranged from $2\varepsilon_y $ to $10\varepsilon_y$, for 3 days to 50 days. Their results determined that a significant effect of strain aging took place from pre-strains $5\varepsilon_y$ and on. Strains higher than $15\varepsilon_y$ indicate a performance level in which substantial damage has been induced in the structure such that it is deemed unrepairable and therefore pre-strains higher than $15\varepsilon_y$ are impractical and were not studied \cite{Momtahan2009}.

Monahan et al correlated the increase in yield strength as a function of time and the pre-strain in reinforcing steel bars. The proposed equations are shown below:

For $10\varepsilon_y$

\begin{equation}
  \frac{f_y}{f_{yi}}=0.0026t+0.9838
  \label{eq.twelve}
\end{equation} 

For $5\varepsilon_y$

\begin{equation}
  \frac{f_y}{f_{yi}}=0.0008t+0.996
  \label{eq.thirteen}
\end{equation} 

For $2\varepsilon_y$

\begin{equation}
  \frac{f_y}{f_{yi}}=0.0004t+0.9979
  \label{eq.fourteen}
\end{equation} 

It is proposed to limit the increase in yield strength obtained at 50 days, which was the limit of the scope of their study. Equations \ref{eq.twelve} to  \ref{eq.fourteen} are plotted in \fref{fig:hist4}

\section{Damage Indexes}
The use of damage indexes has dominated the research related to damage accumulation. While these methods are practical in that they can be easier to deploy in probabilistic analyses and appear to have a logical basis, they are based on empirical relationships and need to be correlated for each structure case to be of any significance. An example is shown in this section that demonstrates this inconsistency. The literature review presented here is to understand what has been done previously to study the effect of damage accumulation. However, this research's purpose is that strain limit states are an improved measure of damage over empirical methods.

Park et al. studied the effect of cumulative damage in structures \cite{Young-JiPark1985}. They proposed the damage index as shown in \eref{eq.DamageIndex}. The damage index was used to quantify damage in terms of the maximum experienced earthquake and the absorbed hysteretic energy.

\begin{equation}
  D=\frac{\Delta_{m}}{\Delta_{u}}-\beta \frac{E_h}{F_{y}\Delta{u}}
  \label{eq.DamageIndex}
\end{equation} 

$\Delta_{m}$: Maximum deformation under earthquake

$\Delta_{u}$: Ultimate deformation under monotonic loading

$F_{y}$: Calculated yield strength

$E_{h}$: Total hysteretic energy

$\beta$: Dimensionless constant 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{Chapter-2/figs/Park_and_Ang_Model}
\caption{Park and Ang conceptual scheme}
\label{fig:Paa}
\end{figure}

Equation \ref{eq.DamageIndex} was derived for concrete elements. The first term here is a simple, pseudo-static displacement measure. The second term accounts for cumulative damage. This concept is shown in \fref{fig:Paa}. The advantages of this model are its simplicity and flexibility in adapting the model to correlate with experimental data. After calculating the damage index, this can be classified according to the damage index level defined by Park and Ang \cite{Young-JiPark1985}. The damage index level classification is shown in Table \ref{tab:DI_Level}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \caption{Damage index level classification \cite{Young-JiPark1985}}
	\label{tab:DI_Level}
	\centering	
        \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \hline
        Level & Damage index (DI)               & Damage measure                                             \\ \hline
        I     & DI\textless{}0.1                & No damage; localized minor cracking                        \\
        II    & 0.1\textless{}DI\textless{}0.25 & Minor damage; light cracking throughout                    \\
        III   & 0.25\textless{}DI\textless{}0.4 & Moderate damage; severe cracking; localized spalling       \\
        IV    & 0.4\textless{}DI\textless{}1.0  & Severe damage; crushing of concrete; reinforcement exposed \\
        V     & D\textgreater{}1.0              & Loss of elemental load resistance                          \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

However, this model has several limitations. Firstly, the calibration of the $\beta$ coefficient with observed damage has proven to be very low ($\beta=0.05-0.15$) \cite{Young-JiPark1985} \cite{Ghosh2015}, rendering the second term relatively inconsequential compared to the contribution of the first term. A sample result is taken from Gosh et al. \cite{Ghosh2015}, which applied a modified version of the Park and Ang damage index in terms of the moment ($M_{y}$), the rotation ($\theta_y$), and curvature ductility ($\mu$). The modified model is expressed in \eref{eq.DamageIndexGhosh}.

\begin{equation}
	D=\frac{\mu_{m}}{\mu_{u}}-\beta\frac{E_h}{M_{y}\theta_y\mu{u}}
	\label{eq.DamageIndexGhosh}
\end{equation}

Using the following values: $\mu_{m}=4.93$; $\mu_{u}=17.02$; $M_{y}=8751.375$; $\theta_y=0.0042$; $E_{h}=119.07$; $\beta=0.05$ 

And substituting in equation \eref{eq.DamageIndexGhosh}:
\[
 D=\frac{\mu_{m}}{\mu_{u}}-\beta\frac{E_h}{M_{y}\theta_y\mu{u}}=0.3
	\]
\textbf{First term}:
\[
\frac{\mu_{m}}{\mu_{u}}=\frac{4.93}{17.02}=0.2897
\]
\textbf{Second term}: 
\[	
	\beta \frac{E_h}{M_{y}\theta_y\mu{u}}=0.05\frac{119.07}{8751.375*0.0042*17.02}=0.0103
\]

It can be seen that 97\% of the damage index comes from the first term, which is the elastic term, and the inelastic part is only 3\% of the total. 

Despite its limitations, several studies have used or modified this model to study cumulative damage effects for different structures. Those of relevant importance are those performed by Kunnath et al. \cite{Kunnath1992}, who used a modified Park and Ang model to account for damage at the local level for elements in the structural analysis program IDARC 3.0. In this software, for the case of multiple degrees of freedom buildings, they also added parameters to consider the damage at the inter-story level and the global model. In addition, Ghosh et al. \cite{Ghosh2015} developed a damage accumulation framework to estimate the probability of exceeding a damage index for multiple ground motions. Other regressions have been proposed \cite{Khashaee}, \cite{Fajfar1992}, \cite{Roufaiel} but show no improvement in assessing the damage state of a structure. While these studies provide an insight into some of the characteristics of damage accumulation, they still rely on the Park and Ang model and carry the same limitations.

Krawinkler (1987) \cite{Krawinkler1987} proposed a method that considered damage as a function of low cycle fatigue parameters. The form of the Krawinkler damage index for steel components, weldments, and local buckling has a general shape to the Miner model. This model relies on the accumulation of plastic deformations. While this model has proven to work well for evaluating individual steel structure elements, it does not provide a way to generalize damage for other types of structures.


\section{Multiple earthquake loading}

The evaluation of multiple seismic events has been scarcely studied; however, they have been felt in numerous earthquake sequences such as the Christchurch 2010, Umbria-Marche Earthquake 1997 and the Puerto Rico Earthquakes 2020. The hypothesis is that the accumulation of damage will restart in a minor seismic event to achieve a prescribed limit state, similar to how corrosion and other aging phenomena might impact the intensity needed to achieve a future limit state. 

In the literature, the study of multiple earthquake loading can be classified into two groups:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mainshock-aftershock sequences
	\item Mainshock sequences
\end{itemize}

These studies have shown some of the effects of multiple earthquake loading for different structures.

\subsection{Mainshock-aftershock sequences loading }

Strong aftershocks can increase the state of damage to a building or even collapse an already damaged structure. Therefore, it is crucial to quantify the increase of seismic demands in structures due to aftershock loading. In recent years different studies have been carried out to develop methodologies that consider these effects.

Tesfamariam et al. \cite{Tesfamariam2015} investigated the increase in the demands for multiple degrees of freedom systems (MDOF). They conducted a parametric study of RC bare frame buildings and RC frames with infill masonry buildings. The main parameter of the study focused on the thickness of the infill frames ranging from 75mm - 125 mm. In addition, a series of mainshock-aftershock sequences were applied, selected for the area of Vancouver, BC. The mainshock-aftershock sequence was selected using the conditional mean spectra (CMS) over the period range of the structures. The motions considered in their study were different for the bare frame and the infill frames. The bare frame was subjected to a mainshock followed by three aftershocks, while those of the infilled frame consisted of one mainshock followed by one aftershock each. Their results showed an increase of 10\% in the inter-story drift demands for the RC basic frame structures. For the case of infill frames, the inter-story drift did not significantly increase. Their study used FEMA 356 \cite{FEMA2000} to define the performance limit states. FEMA 356 drift performance limit states are based on linear regression on observed damage to drift level obtained from experimental tests. The linear regression compared to the experimental results have high dispersion. Therefore, it is possible that in the study by Tesfamariam et al., while a drift limit state did not increase after applying an MS-AS sequence, a higher strain was reached in some of the components due to the MS-AS sequence, and as a consequence, a higher strain performance limit state could have been reached. Their results emphasized the importance of using strain performance limit states.
Similarly, Raghunandan et al. \cite{Raghunandan2015} studied the vulnerability of RC frame structures. Their study showed that depending on the level of interstory drift achieved during the mainshock, the additional damage experienced during the aftershock would be different. For example, the authors showed that for an RC frame that experiences 4\% or more interstory drift in the mainshock, the median capacity to resist aftershock shaking is reduced by about 40\%. Furthermore, other studies have focused on the behavior of single degree of freedom (SDOF) systems response to mainshock-aftershock (MS-AS) sequences \cite{Hatzigeorgiou2009}\cite{Manafpour2019}. Hatzigeorgiou et al. focused on determining the inelastic displacement coefficient variation due to the MS-AS sequence. Their study concluded that there is an increase in the inelastic displacement demands. However, the limitations in their study did not report what happens to the performance limit states. Further, Manafpour et al. studied the seismic drift behavior of structures to MS-AS sequences for far-field earthquakes and near-field earthquakes. Their study concluded that for SDOF structures, near-field earthquake sequences were the most damaging, increasing the drifts by as much as 45\% compared to a structure subjected to the mainshock only.

Researchers have applied three earthquake selection procedures for mainshock-aftershock sequences. The first method, incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), consists of 1)subjecting the nonlinear building model to a ground motion having a particular intensity, 2) recording the response of the structure \cite{Vamvatsikos2002}, 3)in subsequent analyses, the ground motion is incrementally scaled to a higher intensity measure (IM), and 4)the structural response is recorded in each analysis. The IDA procedure was extrapolated for MS-AS sequence as follows: 1)Apply the IDA to the mainshocks to obtain 11 drift damage levels raging from 0.5\% to 5.5\% of interstory drift in the structure, 2) after each mainshock, include an incrementally scaled aftershock with a 4 seconds gap between the mainshock and the aftershock, and 3)Change the polarity of the aftershock, which refers to the direction of the aftershock variation to the mainshock. \fref{fig:MS-AS_Luco} shows one of the resulting MS-AS sequences using the IDA methodology. Due to scaling factors, the IDA methodology uses artificial mainshock-aftershock sequences. Therefore, the IDA analysis can be computationally expensive. For instance, the authors reported 9900 ground motion sequences per structure.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Chapter-2/figs/MS-AS_sequence_Luco}
\caption{Mainshock-aftershock sequence train of ground motions \cite{Raghunandan2015}}
\label{fig:MS-AS_Luco}
\end{figure}

The second method matches the MS-AS sequences to a site seismic hazard curve obtained from a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). Tesfamariam \cite{Tesfamariam2015} used conditional mean spectra (CMS) to match and select mainshock-aftershock sequences for structures located in Vancouver, BC. Their study selected MS-AS sequences from two databases of ground motions, NGA-West2 \citep{Ancheta2014}, and the K-NET//KiK-net \cite{NIEDK-NETKiK-net2019}. The CMS process consists of computing the expected response spectrum associated with a target spectral acceleration ($Sa$) value at a single period, using the known values from the PSHA such as the magnitude, distance, and $\epsilon$ values. The authors used CMS to select the MS-AS sequences for different earthquake scenarios a)Crustal earthquake, b) Interface, and c) Inslab. They hypothesized that different earthquake scenarios would have different MS-AS sequence characteristics, such as higher spectral acceleration ($Sa$) values at short periods for interface earthquakes and high $Sa$ values at more extended periods for crustal earthquakes. They argue that using the CMS method makes the selection of ground motion consistent with the seismological features of the study area. \fref{fig:MS-AS_Goda} shows this selection for a structure with a 0.4s period for crustal earthquakes. The CMS method adapts to the site conditions. No scaling of MS-AS is required since the selection is optimized to ground motion sequences stored in the databases. Since the CMS method uses site-specific data, it can be a part of an analytical framework that can be adapted to different seismic regions.

\caption{Mainshock-aftershock sequence selection at T=0.4s for crustal earthquakes in Vancouver, British Columbia \cite{Tesfamariam2015}}
\label{fig:MS-AS_Goda}
\end{figure}

Finally, the third method consists of unscaled ground motion sequences. Ruiz Garcia et al. \cite{Ruiz-Garcia2008} examined the response of 9 typical low-height reinforced concrete highway bridges under 26 as-recorded mainshock–aftershocks sequences gathered in the subduction zone of the Mexican Pacific Coast. They found that aftershocks do not significantly increase drift demands due to the inherent overstrength in the study-case low-height highway bridges\cite{Ruiz-Garcia2008}. In addition, Ruiz Garcia et al. \citep{Ruiz-Garcia2011} in another study determined that that Non-Degrading Systems are unaffected by recorded MS-AS sequences for steel-frame models, which did include p-delta effects but not the degradation of the hysteresis of the connections. The study by Ruiz-Garcia also demonstrated that the effect of the aftershock is not substantial due to the different frequency contents of the ground motion as shown in \fref{fig:MS-AS_Ruiz}. However, they also noted an apparent increase in the demands if the sequences are altered. The limitations of these studies are that the degradation of the structural systems was not included, and only shallow crustal earthquakes were considered.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Mainshock sequences loading}

Reliable temporal prediction of earthquakes is currently impossible. However, earthquake recurrence time can be modeled reasonably well as a Poisson process for a large region. Sunasaka \cite{Sunasaka1993} developed mainshock sequences that followed a Poisson process. Their study focused on the accumulation of damage due to mainshock sequences and mainshocks-aftershocks sequences. Damage accumulation was accounted for by the Park and Ang index. The authors used ground motion prediction equations to develop artificial mainshock sequences. Their study calculated each mainshock's recurrence period, magnitude, location, and peak ground acceleration. Finally, the author subjected an SDOF bridge in Eureka, CA, to the mainshock sequence shown in   \fref{fig:MS-MS_Sunasaka}. While the results show a significant increase in the damage index due to mainshock sequences, the conclusions are limited by the assumption that a Poisson process can be applied to single faults, which has not shown a good correlation with observed events\cite{Shearer2009}. While this study shows what could be possible if mainshocks were predictable in small regions, more seismology advances are needed to apply the proposed methodology confidently.

Other studies have used three equally spaced mainshocks \cite{Hatzigeorgiou2009}. The three equally spaced mainshocks can be deployed without much computational effort. However, there is no seismological basis for using three equally spaced mainshocks. Therefore, the use of this methodology would be limited to scenario analysis and not valid for analysis and design since the probabilities of three equally spaced in time mainshocks on any given structure are very low.

\section{Aging of structures}

There have been attempts by many researchers to characterize the aging of structures.

In recent years studies have focused on the effect of cumulative damage. These studies have focused on assessing the damage accumulation considering multiple earthquakes, corrosion, and service life of the structure. Two fields of study have been observed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Probabilistic framework
	\item Fragility curves
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Probabilistic Framework}

One of the most widely used probabilistic frameworks is the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER) Performance Based Design (PBD). PEER PBD can be expressed by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\nu_{DM}(dm^{LS})=\iint D_{DM|EDP}(dm|edp)|,dG_{EDP|IM}(edp|im)||\,d\nu_{IM}(im)|
\end{equation}

Mackie et al. \cite{Mackie2007} using the PEER PBD, developed the performance-based damage design (PBDD) and performance-based loss design (PBLD) by defining the probabilistic demand, damage, and loss model parameters in terms of reinforced concrete column damage. The RC column damage was defined as mean drift ratios obtained from the PEER structural performance database (http://nisee.berkeley.edu/spd/). The drift limit states considered in their study were concrete spalling, bar buckling, and failure. In their study, failure was defined as the first occurrence of the database fields for reinforcing bar fracture and loss of axial load-carrying capacity 

The authors show that for a given intensity measure ($IM$) and a confidence level of achieving a limit state, it is possible to define the probability of exceeding that limit state. The authors used peak ground velocity ($PGV$) as their intensity measure. While this methodology was able to define the damage and incorporate it into the PEER PBD framework, the authors did not consider strain to define the limit states. In a PEER report, Mackie et al. studied seismic demands for the performance-based design of bridges. In the report, they performed a design parameter sensitivity analysis to evaluate different intensity measures. Their analysis showed that the optimal $IM$ to predict most engineering demand parameters ($EDP$) is the first mode spectral displacement $Sd(T_{1})$  \cite{Mackie2003}. However, at the time their report was written, the $Sd(T_{1})$ did not show a good correlation with strain as the $EDP$, and as a consequence, they did not recommend using strain as a predictor of structural performance. Nonetheless, a recent study presented by Krish et al. showed that new advancements in the modeling of plastic hinge forming members could more accurately relate strain and $S_{d}(T_{1})$. Therefore, they concluded that the use of these parameters is well suited to predict the performance of structures \cite{Krish2018}.

\textbf{Fragility Curves}

Another common trend in this subject is the use of fragility curves to estimate the effect of damage on structures. Two main approaches were found in the literature. One relied on the Park and Ang Model damage index to define damage, while the second approach related damage to drift.

Ghosh et al. \cite{Ghosh2015} formulated a damage accumulation framework. Their study relied on the Park, and Ang Damage index explained in the previous section. In addition, the study performed a series of nonlinear time history analyses for two cases:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Using a constant main shock hazard occurrence rate (3 main shocks in a 50-year period)
	\item Mainshock - Aftershock series using a time-dependent aftershock hazard occurrence rate
\end{itemize}

The results from their study showed regression equations that statistically predict the damage index as a function of earthquake intensity and damage history. This study revealed that for both mainshock and aftershock scenarios, there was a significant increase in the probability of damage index exceeding a damage index level (as defined in Table \ref{tab:DI_Level}) under repeated shock scenarios. While this study shows the importance of considering damage accumulation, these results have to be taken with caution since they present the same disadvantages as the Park and Ang damage index.

Ghosh et al \cite{Ghosh2010} also studied the effects of corrosion on time-dependent seismic fragility curves. Their study characterizes corrosion in concrete columns as a continuous phenomenon that occurs as a function of time. The authors also considered the effects of corrosion on steel bridge bearings. The authors then ran a series of NLTHA analyses for different aging times of the structures. Based on their analysis, time-dependent fragility curves were presented. The results showed that as time increases and corrosion increases, the probability of exceeding a limit state increases. In their study, limit states were defined based on inter-story drifts, which were obtained from experimental results and field observations \cite{Padgett2007}. It is essential to mention that the limit states used in their study were not defined based on strains or other structural properties. Instead, the limit states came from a survey performed in central and southeastern United States departments of transportation on the premise of a range of experienced inter-story drifts and the time is taken to repair them. In addition, assuming that corrosion is a continuous process has to be cautiously taken as valid since site information such as temperature, water to cement ratio, the addition of cementitious materials such as silica fume, and the environment (e.g., coastal vs. inland) affect the rate of propagation of corrosion\cite{Thoft-Christensen}.

While these studies provide a general view of how damage increases the likelihood of observing collapse or deterioration of the seismic performance, the methods used to arrive at those conclusions can be misleading since the definition of damage as either a Damage Index or Drift is not the best parameters to quantify the damage. Therefore, we believe that strain-based limit states will better understand the implications of damage accumulation.

\section{Research Gap}

Many studies have tried to show the importance of quantifying the effects of accumulated damage and multiple shocks throughout the lifetime of a structure. Therefore, it is essential to develop a model that establishes the likelihood of achieving a limit state as the structure ages. In addition,  it is crucial to understand the impacts of aging on bridge seismic performance. Furthermore, bridges in seismic areas can be subjected to mainshock and aftershocks. Therefore, a methodology that incorporates aging and multiple seismic events is needed.

Damage accumulation is a topic gaining momentum in the engineering community. This study will better inform the potential future conditions of a structure to stakeholders such as state DOTs, building owners, and practicing engineers. The literature observed that damage accumulation had been studied using the Park and Ang damage index or drift-based limit states to measure damage accumulation. Different researchers have also included corrosion in their scope of analysis, which shows that aging conditions play an essential role in the deterioration of a structure. In addition, Krish \cite{Krish2018} determined that spectral displacement at the first effective period is an improved intensity measure (IM), while the past literature used the peak ground acceleration (PGA) as the controlling IM. This research will develop a parametric study using a single degree of freedom (SDOF) systems, subjecting them to different conditions such as corrosion and steel strain aging. The SDOF structures will be subjected to a sweep of ground motions using nonlinear time history analysis to obtain maximum strain demands. With the results from NLTHA, fragility functions will be used to show the increase in the likelihood of reaching a performance limit state due to the aging of the structure. In addition, this research will provide the engineering community with a design framework to account for damage accumulation in their analysis and guide decisions on the resiliency of a structure. In addition, this study will provide a methodology in which the Direct Displacement-Based Design (DDBD) is modified to consider the effects of the damage and aging conditions.
