Developing a design procedure that provides resilient bridges is one of the main goals of this study.This research will develop a displacement based design tool, that achieves that goal. This chapter firts introduces the overall design concept; then the direct displacement based design (DDBD) is reviewed and proposed modifications to this design methodology, based on corroded RC physical tests results, are shown. Finally a schedule of work is presented.
